# JavaScript project #1 - TO00BL79-3004

## Todo

General:

- Add comments (JSDoc)
- Finish this readme
- Make the app more visually appealing
- Make the error box prettier and maybe dismissible?
- Move import/export links somewhere else
- Test everything at least twice.
- ~~Publish the site to somewhere~~
- ~~Remove unused CSS selectors from main.css~~
- ~~Try to shorten main.js and isolate stuff into their own modules~~

Features:

- Give user the option to give task-list custom name
- ~~Add option to reset everything~~
- ~~Add option to clear tasks that are done.~~
- ~~Make the site mobile friendly~~

## What needs fixing

- ~~Validate input from import~~ (partially implemented)
- ~~toString() and toJSON() methods in List and LocalStorage are badly named. Need renaming.~~
- ~~Rename LocalStorage to something else, eg. TaskStorage to avoid confusion with built-in class Storage and localStorage() method.~~
- ~~If user reads import warning for too long the browser refuses to open "add file" dialog.~~
