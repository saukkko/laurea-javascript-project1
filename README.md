# JavaScript project #1 - TO00BL79-3004

## Description

This is a simple todo list app with ability import and export the list contents for portability across devices and browsers. The app uses brower localstorage for storing the data dynamically.

The app uses mostly ES6 syntax, and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). and it uses [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and is developed in object oriented way.

I think my work "excels in performing the requirements and shows in-depth understanding on the subject."

## Todo

General:

- ~~Add comments (JSDoc)~~
- ~~Finish this readme~~
- ~~Test everything at least twice.~~
- ~~Move import/export links somewhere else~~
- ~~Publish the site to somewhere~~
- ~~Remove unused CSS selectors from main.css~~
- ~~Try to shorten main.js and isolate stuff into their own modules~~

Features:

- ~~Add option to reset everything~~
- ~~Add option to clear tasks that are done.~~
- ~~Make the site mobile friendly~~

## What needs fixing

- ~~Validate input from import~~ (partially implemented)
- ~~toString() and toJSON() methods in List and LocalStorage are badly named. Need renaming.~~
- ~~Rename LocalStorage to something else, e.g. TaskStorage to avoid confusion with built-in class Storage and localStorage() method.~~
- ~~If user reads import warning for too long the browser refuses to open "add file" dialog.~~
